## Installation

### CocoaPods

To use **SwiftLinkPreview** as a pod package just add the following in your **Podfile** file.

```ruby
	source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
	platform :ios, '9.0'

	target 'Your Target Name' do
	  	use_frameworks!
	  	// ...
	  	pod 'SwiftLinkPreview', '~> 3.5.0'
	  	// ...
	end
```

### Carthage

To use **SwiftLinkPreview** as a Carthage module package just add the following in your **Cartfile** file.

```ruby
  	// ...
	github "LeonardoCardoso/SwiftLinkPreview" ~> 3.5.0
  	// ...
```

### Swift Package Manager

To use **SwiftLinkPreview** as a Swift Package Manager package just add the following in your **Package.swift** file.

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "Your Target Name",
  dependencies: [
  	// ...
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso/SwiftLinkPreview.git", "3.5.0")
  	// ...
  ]
)
```

### Manually

You just need to drop all contents in `Sources` folder, **but .plist files**, into Xcode project (make sure to enable "Copy items if needed" and "Create groups").


## Usage

#### Instatiating
```swift
import SwiftLinkPreview

// ...

let slp = SwiftLinkPreview(session: URLSession.shared,
			   workQueue: SwiftLinkPreview.defaultWorkQueue,
			   responseQueue: DispatchQueue.main,
		           cache: DisabledCache.instance)
```

#### Requesting preview
```swift
let preview = slp.preview("Text containing URL",
                          onSuccess: { result in print("\(result)") },
                          onError: { error in print("\(error)")})
// preview.cancel() to cancel it.
```
**result** is a struct ```Response```:

```swift
Response {
	let baseURL: String? // base
	let url: URL? // URL
	let finalUrl: URL? // unshortened URL
	let canonicalUrl: String? // canonical URL
	let title: String? // title
	let description: String? // page description or relevant text
	let images: [String]? // array of URLs of the images
	let image: String? // main image
	let icon: String? // favicon
	let video: String? // video
	let price: String? // price
}
```

#### Cancelling a request
```swift
let cancelablePreview = slp.preview(...,
				    onSuccess: ...,
				    onError: ...)

cancelablePreview.cancel()
```

#### Enabling and accessing cache

SLP has a built-in memory cache, so create your object as the following:

```swift
let slp = SwiftLinkPreview(cache: InMemoryCache())
```

To get the cached response:

```swift
if let cached = self.slp.cache.slp_getCachedResponse(url: String) {
    // Do whatever with the cached response
} else {
	// Perform preview otherwise
	slp.preview(...)
}
```

If you want to create your own cache, just implement this protocol and use it on the object initializer.

```swift
public protocol Cache {

    func slp_getCachedResponse(url: String) -> SwiftLinkPreview.Response?

    func slp_setCachedResponse(url: String, response: SwiftLinkPreview.Response?)
}
```

# FLOW

## Important

You need to set ```Allow Arbitrary Loads``` to ```YES``` on your project's Info.plist file.

If you don't want to use the option above and you are using ```SwiftLinkPreview``` for services of your knowledge, you can whitelist them on Info.plist file as well. You can read more about it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30739473/nsurlsession-nsurlconnection-http-load-failed-on-ios-9), [here](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire#app-transport-security) and [here](https://ste.vn/2015/06/10/configuring-app-transport-security-ios-9-osx-10-11/).

## Tips

Not all websites will have their info brought, you can treat the info that your implementation gets as you like. But here are two tips about posting a preview:

* If some info is missing, you can offer the user to enter it. Take for example the description.
* If more than one image is fetched, you can offer the user the feature of picking one image.

## Tests

Feel free to fork this repo and add URLs on [SwiftLinkPreviewTests/URLs.swift](SwiftLinkPreviewTests/URLs.swift) to test URLs and help improving this lib. The more URLs the better the reliability.
